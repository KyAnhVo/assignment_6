# echo_s echo_c log_s

## Description
- echo_c is used to send information, either using tcp or udp protocol,
  to an ip address, with specified port number.
- echo_s is used to receive information from both tcp and udp protocol
  to a specified port number (and the host computer's ip address)
- log_s is used to log informations received by echo_s into echo.log

## Instruction
- run the following commands for compilation:
    make echo_s
    make echo_c
    make log_s
- to run echo_s:
    ./echo_s <port number>
    + <port number>: port number to receive data from
- to run echo_c:
    ./echo_c <protocol> <IP address> <port number>
    + <protocol>: -u (udp) or -t (tcp)
    + <IP address>: IP address to send data to
    + <port number>: port on receiving machine
- to run log_s:
    ./log_s

## Note
- echo_s and log_s are expected to run on the same machine with port 9999 open,
  due to echo_s use loopback address to communicate with log_s
- echo.log will appear when log_s is run
- The maximum message length echo_s can handle at a time is 99 bytes (plus 1 byte for the null terminator).
